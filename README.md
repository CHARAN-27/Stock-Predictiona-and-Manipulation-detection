This project aim is to predict the stock price using historical data with the support of the 
sentimental analysis done for the news headlines and detect the manipulation of the stock 
using machine learning models if any.

If the user wants to invest in a particular company share we will give the predicted stock prices of the company in a particular period of time 
and recommend it to the user and the prediction is done using sentimental analysis. 

In the manipulation detection after collecting the manipulated data from the trusted websites we start with the GAN to generate 
the new synthetic data from the collected data as the manipulated data found will be very less.
We do trials using real-world datasets of news articles or headlines on the stock market.
